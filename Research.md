# Industrial Large-Format 3D Printer

Through my high school's engineering block program, [Payton Kick](https://www.instagram.com/paytonkick/?hl=en) and I designed and built a custom 3D Printer using high quality components. Designed for industrial reliabilty, this project's goals included workplace safety (enclosed design), print reliability (stable frame), and speed ([CoreXY](https://corexy.com) linear motion method). Below are pictures from the final product.
